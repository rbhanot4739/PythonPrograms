  - Move command
	You can move a line, or a block of lines, with the :m command. Examples:

	:m 12	move current line to after line 12
	:m 0	move current line to before first line
	:m $	move current line to after last line
	:m 'a	move current line to after line with mark a (see using marks)
	:m 'a-1	move current line to before line with mark a
	:m '}-1	move current line to the end of the current paragraph
	For clarity, a space is shown after the :m commands above, but that space is not required.

	To move a block of lines, use the same command but visually select the lines before entering the move command. You can also use arbitrary ranges with the move command. Examples:

	:5,7m 21	move lines 5, 6 and 7 to after line 21
	:5,7m 0	move lines 5, 6 and 7 to before first line
	:5,7m $	move lines 5, 6 and 7 to after last line
	:.,.+4m 21	move 5 lines starting at current line to after line 21
	:,+4m14	same (. for current line is assumed)

Search & Replace - Really niche stuff

- *:%s//spam/g --> to replace the word under cursor
- Repeate last substitution using @: or & nnoremap & :&&<cr> [try this]
- "(R)eplace all
	nnoremap <leader>r yiw:s/\<<C-r>"\>//g<left><left>     * Recommeneded as it maintains word boundary
	nnoremap <leader>r :%s/\<<C-r><C-w>\>//g<left><left>
- Replace with confirmation
		nnoremap <leader>r yiw:%s/\<<C-r>"\>//gc<left><left><left>
